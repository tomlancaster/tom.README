Tom's Manager README - how to work with me


## My Job

As a manager I work for my direct reports, and not vice versa. I'm here to hire, retain, and develop the best people for YunoJuno, and if I'm ever behaving in a way that works against those goals please let me know right away.

## Personal Principles

### Assumption of good intentions

I'll admit this doesn't always come naturally to me, but as a general rule there's a lot to be said for assuming the person you're talking with means you no harm, and for interpreting what they're doing or saying on that basis. It has worked well for me so far.

### Honesty

While my position in the company may require me not to disclose certain things I will never lie to you.

### Meetings

Meetings can be very useful, but they can also be an expensive drain on the company's time and talent if not run well. Three things are essential to making meetings work:

1. The meeting has a written agenda or purpose, which is shared with participants beforehand.
2. Only people who need to be in the meeting are required to attend. In general meetings work better the fewer people attend (within reason).
3. Every meeting should end with an assignment of action items. Every attendee should be clear what was decided and who is going to take the next steps.

### Punctuality

If I'm running a meeting I prefer that everybody show up on time. If I'm attending a meeting I will do everything I can to be there on time.


## One on Ones

One on one meetings are very important. I learned some of the principles of sucessful one on one's from Andy Grove's book _High Output Management_. The important things are:

* This is your meeting, not mine.
* I don't really want status updates, unless you really want to give them. I get that mostly from Jira or standup.
* This can be an opportunity to tell me how you think the team could work better together, or highlight some area of conflict I might not be aware of.
* I enjoy talking about the big picture, so if you do, too, this is a great forum for that kind of chat.


## Feedback

Feedback is very valuable to me. Receiving feedback is something I've had to work on during my career, so please give me more opportunities to practice!

For feedback to work, it needs to be

* Safe (you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback)
* Easy (the recipient should make it easy to give feedback)
* Beneficial (giving / receiving feedback should provide a benefit)


## My Calendar

Is often fairly open. Please feel free to throw an event on my calendar if you want to meet. If I'm not in office or you're not in office it's fine to meet on a Slack video call.


## Remote work / Working from Home
